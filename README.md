# HighlightGPT
A chrome extension that gets gpt-3 to explain what the highlighted text in the browser is. I don't actually know how to code, I used chatGPT, so this is probably trash coding but it 
works so I don't care that much.

Still have some stuff to do on this, but I'm happy I could accomplish this.

I have an idea to expand it into something cool, but I don't know how to do it. Maybe one day.
